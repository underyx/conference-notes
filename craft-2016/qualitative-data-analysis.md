# "Thick" Data and Analysis: Engineering with a capital E

http://beta.craft-conf.com/speaker/JohnAllspaw

- The term thick data seems to be referring to non-quantitative data, such as
  written statements that use non-specific words, including 'I feel like' and
  the like. Or simply: qualitative data.
  - 'Reason about' as an expression like this as well actually.
  - High volume, isolation, micro, etc. are other examples
  - 'I know it when I see it'
- The Engineering Method: "The strategy for causing the best change in a
  poorly undersood ot uncertain environment with limited resources."
- We're doing complex work, and when we're successful, it's largely invisible.
  - Such as an 'LGTM' that doesn't really reflect how much thought went into
    making that comment.
- We don't know how we do our work :(
- Data != numbers. Don't dismiss stories.
  - Case studies give you a story with its real context.
- Anomaly/outage response doesn't happen like we imagine.
  - 'What? Why? What? How???'
- Example time! Presenter's thesis was about this:
  - Personalized suggestions weren't showing on Etsy.
  - Process tracing/protocol analysis: take all thick data from the incident
    (chat logs, bash history, access logs, etc.) and analyze it
  - Note: You really need to look at the slides here, I don't think there's
    a good way to describe this. It's really cool though.
  - Interviews work only if you have this data and explicitly ask about it,
    otherwise the engineers don't remember.
- Book 'Talking about machines', author spent a lot of time with photocopier
  repair technicians.
  - TODO: Read this!
  - They didn't put too much faith in the manuals, they relied mostly on each
    others' stories over lunch. Including where the manual was wrong.
  - Paraphrased: 'The hardest part of diagnosis is making sense out of a
    fundamentally ambiguous set of facts, which is done through a narrative.'
- Another book: 'What Engineers Know and How They Know It'.
- And another! 'The Challenger Launch Decision'.
  - Paraphrased: 'The most complete account of what was happening at NASA at
    the time.'
- We need more books about this stuff!
- *Booooooooooks!* 'Human Factors and Ergonomics in Practice'.
- Basically the takeaway is that we need to analyze qualitative data!
  - Tells you lots about personal development's circumstances.
  - Shape tools based on the results. Even stuff like shell aliases.
- But to avoid mistakes, you should talk to psychologists/social scientists,
  'folk models' and biases are fairly dangerous.

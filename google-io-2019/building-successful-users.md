https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/50bbf64a-1cc4-4169-b91b-1b124b769d07

- Tokopedia increased conversion 5x by AMP and PWA
- Spotify also increased engagement with PWA
- Users just want a good experience, don't care if it's a PWA or any other fancy tech
- Twitter has a PWA now with one code base for everything
- Hulu also has a PWA on desktop
  - Weird, Hulu's being showcased left and right while Netflix is nowhere to be seen

## Twitter's Story

- The single code base brings faster updates, a more consistent experience
- Started rewrite with the mobile experience
  - At each step, started to wonder what's unique to the next device target
- Desktop is expected to be more powerful, mobile to be more lightweight
- PWA was launched as Twitter Lite in 2017, was 30% faster to load, included bundle splitting
- User feedback was positive on the Lite app
- Discoverability was problematic, they ended up publishing a Web View wrapper app
  cause users were looking in the Play Store for Twitter Lite
  - Play store also gave nice satisfaction metrics and feedback channels
- Today they use the Add to Home Screen prompt, the Play Store, and PWABuilder.com
- Expanding was based on modality instead of just mobile vs. desktop
  - check slides, there were ~15 examples
- Using React
  - If they detect a feature phone, they just render a soft button bar, instead of FAB, etc.
- Start with designing the core experience first, and build the rest around that
- **Tweets sent increased 3x**

## Times Internet's Story

- Times Internet has .5B users per month on news sites, they're big in India
  - Note it's not related to the New York Times or anything you knew of, probably
- By 2023 Indian internet users are expected to grow 40%, smartphone users by 2x
  - Hindi users are growing 94% yearly, already surpassed English
- Performance is critical in these markets
  - Times is using resource budgeting, alerts if anything is crossed
- webpack-bundle-analyzer helped reduce size by 70%
- lazy image loading and offline caching help a lot, too
- They actually have a 100 score on Lighthouse
- **you can strategically time the PWA install prompt when users are most engaged**
- PWA installs are free, zero marketing spend
- integrating the web share API increased share based visits by 24%
- session duration increased 31%, 59% increase in ad revenue

## Hulu's Story

- They say they're the fastest growing streaming service ðŸ¤”
- They re-launched in 2018 September
  - And they got a Webby award this year for best streaming site
- In 2015 they made a Universal Windows app which was badly reviewed and mostly ignored
  - And the reviewers said the website was better
  - Why did users use the app then instead of the site? Cause it was installable
  - So make the site installable, lol
- Started small: added a manifest and a service worker
  - Even this was challenging
- The service worker was scoped to /app/, and a native app wrapper was pointed there,
  so they wouldn't be impacting the main site at first.
- They used skipWaiting, didn't catch what that was
- They used a network-only cache policy for TV show data
- This PWA was built in 2 weeks by 1 developer
- 96% of legacy app users migrated to PWA
- **Return visits increased 27%**
- Saw a 5.5% increase in engagement
- App reviews improved a lot
- Think about offline caching creatively:
  **they're planning to use offline mode to play cached trailers**

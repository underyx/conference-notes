# The Zen of Python Teams

https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/168/

## "Beautiful is better than ugly"

- subjective, huh
- "acting ugly" is a thing, that applies to people
- hoarding information is a way of acting ugly in teams
- bitter and cutting code reviews are also a form of acting ugly
- There's a "Westrum typology of organizational cultures" with three types:
  - pathological: information is a personal resource for political benefit
  - bureaucratic: individuals feel connected to their team rather than the company
  - generative: the leader rallies people around the company mission
    - people feel safe to take risks
- kind behavior is actually not that subjective, huh
- Book recommendation: "Nicole Forsgren: Accelerate"

## "Explicit is better than implicit"

- Documenting processes makes it easier for others to join
- People are cheating when they have relationships/backchannels to get themselves unblocked
- Keep chat about code in a public place, don't bury information in DMs
  - Slack is not documentation, though
- Document SLAs for better inter-team relationships
- Document people, too!
  - "I enjoy working on"
  - "I struggle when"
  - "I get excited by"
  - "Work I'm proud of includes"
  - "Ask me to help with"
  - "I feel appreciated when"

## "Simple is better than complex"

- have "remote happy hour" for just hanging out
  - the benefit is not immediately obvious

## "Errors should never pass silently"

- "If I do something to hurt someone, I wanna know"
- feedback is the tool for handling these errors in teams

## "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess"

- Don't guess at people's motives, ask what they're trying to accomplish
- Don't guess about what direct reports are doing about
  what's motivating, what are the struggles, how people want to grow

## Now is better than never

- Take some action, even if it's small
- Even if you're wrong, it gives you information
- "Doing and being wrong is a lot better than not doing at all"

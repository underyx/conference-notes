# Effectively Structuring Slack

- Define what you're trying to get out of Slack
- We could have a live #plz-executives session
- Reaching out to other companies to ask for naming conventions, channel managment, etc. advice is nice
- 3500 public channels at TripAdvisor
- "fewer workspaces, more channels"
- 1400 workspaces at the other guy
- Document naming conventions, set default channels, provide guidance on when private channels are ok to use
- Empower everyone to keep Slack neat and tidy, don't waste your time being Slack police
- You might wanna conduct Slack trainings on Slack

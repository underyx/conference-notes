# HR & Slack — Cultivating Positive Employee Experiences

## Shopify's Experience

- Implemented no meetings Wednesdays by just wiping calendars on Monday
  - Meetings slowly crept back in,
    so an employee made a "chaos-monkey" bot that pings people on Thursday if they had Wednesday meetings
- Use Fellow which prepares one-on-one agenda, you can also use it to request start/stop/continue feedback
- To combat Slack distractions:
  use DnD, avoid whistle-pings ("hey… [crickets]"), don't Slack-bomb with a dozen notifications
- How do you moderate inappropriate conversations?
  Well, just reply respectfully, it's better if it's visible on Slack rather than happening over drinks or something.

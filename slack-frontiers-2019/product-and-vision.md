# Product and Vision

- small tip from what Slack does: complaints go to #beef-tweets
  - each team has an emoji and they take ownership by reacting with their emoji
- shared channels coming to enterprise grid in 2019 summer
- surprising how much they're talking about shared channels,
  explaining it from the basics as if people didn't know about them,
  but I guess that might be cause it's really been in beta since forever (2 years ago maybe?)
  Also, maybe this is something that Microsoft Teams cannot compete with and that's why they talk about it so much.
- They say using shared channels to talk to customers increased Fastly's net promoter score

## Workflow Builder

- visual tool to automate stuff in Slack
- triggers can be channel join, slash command, message action
- actions can be sending a message, or providing users a form

## Random tools

- If someone is invited to Slack but hasn't onboarded yet,
  they'll get messages through email which they can reply to via email
- heh "your designers might be using Dropbox Paper while most of the organization is in Google Drive"
- Slack can preview .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx now
- Google Calendar app will update your status automatically
- Slack gets contextual actions inline in people's messages, like Facebook Messenger's "Create a plan?"
  Namely for scheduling Google Calendar events.
